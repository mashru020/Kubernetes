"No route to host" when trying to connect to a TCP service on an Oracle Cloud Intance

The following extra steps were needed on the Oracle cloud, to open up ports on Ubuntu 20:

    sudo vim /etc/iptables/rules.v4 (or whatever editor you use)

    After the line -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT , insert:

-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 1234 -j ACCEPT

(change the number of the port that needs to be opened!)

    At the shell prompt:

sudo su -

iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

exit

    The newly-opened port may be tested by going on another Linux machine, and issuing the command:

nc -zvw100  THE_IP_ADDRESS_OF_MACHINE_WHOSE_PORT_WE_OPENED  THE_PORT_NUMBER
